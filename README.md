wickett's vimrc
-----

## Adding additional comments

This initially started out as a fork of adam-vim, but after finding vim-boostrap, thats now what I use. The vimrc file in the root of the repo is just vim-boostrap with one minor fix for my mac. The custom stuff has now been moved over to `.vimrc.local.bundles` and `.vimrc.local`.   

## My setup
I am using a mac with iTerm2, vim (from homebrew) and tmux (also from homebrew).  I am not using macvim.

Pre-reqs

```
$ brew install ctags git
$ git clone git@github.com:wickett/wickett-vim.git ~/.vim
```

To Install

```
$ cd ~/.vim
$ make install

# This does a make clean and make config
```

To Update

```
$ cd ~/.vim
$ make update
# Follow instructions
```

## Important configuration stuff
Leader is mapped to ','
